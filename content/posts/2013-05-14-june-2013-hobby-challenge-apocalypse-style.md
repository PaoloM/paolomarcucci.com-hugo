Aside from my new armored goodies, I’d like to build a SpecOps squad for my Deathwing. I’m not sure what to do, and what kind of equipment would be legal to give them, but the idea is to have a fairly quirky unit that may not be very effective in common situations but is absolutely badass in some limited circumstances.

Any idea? Theme? Suggestion?

**Updated on May 14, 2013**

Yeah, that was the thing. Any Deathwing squad is made of veterans, the only more-than-veterans are the Knights.

There’s nothing specific in the codex about different squad types, so I’ll just read a bit more (maybe some fiction) and get some ideas

Oh I forgot about the Deathwatch…

Enough info on white dwarf to build something, or maybe in the big rulebook?

Focus being one of my main strengths, I went out and bought an Ironclad Dreadnought.

Here it is as a work in progress, the sarcophagus cover and leg armor are customized with Dark Angels iconography, the legs are magnetized to the torso, and I stuck some magnets into the arm pilons as well.

Let’s see where it goes this weekend

You mean, based already?

Also, that finished my Skeleton Bone primer. Another can is on order from Amazon, for the other two dreads and the Land Raider Achilles…

I noticed that Apocalypse is coming and so I focused my efforts into larger models.

Here’s my first attempt.

It was bound to happen. I am now owner of a Paasche double action airbrush.

Did some experimentation with Vallejo Air Light Brown and… there’s definitely a learning curve

But the results are awesome. Can’t wait to start my interrogator chaplain in Terminator armor…

Weapons and left arm still to finish. But we’re looking good, Antonius!

Ready to be properly based! I’m kinda proud of the glowing eyes…

And here’s the Deathwing management overhead! Antonius, Belial and Quinctilius…

I found a bunch of old metal Vor minis in one of my boxes never opened since the great divorce of 2006.

Specifically, 35 [Union troops](http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=vor+union+miniatures&amp;go=&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBIR&amp;pq=vor+union+miniatures&amp;sc=1-20&amp;sp=-1&amp;sk=#a) in various stages of painting. I was wondering if these could be used as replacement for Imperial Guard troops, something I could field along my upcoming Dark Angels 3rd company…

My only concern is the size. They are quite large, for non-power armored guys, and I haven’t seen an IG mini in person yet.

What do you think? Usable? Ridicolous?

<a href="/blog/images/union-size.jpg">![union-size](/blog/images/union-size.jpg)</a>

**Updated on June 21, 2013**

It turns out that I could be able to field a reasonable 575 points of Imperial Guard using my existing minis…

From the right:

Platoon composed by:

    *   Command squad with platoon standard (not in picture) and 3 sniper rifles.
    *   Special weapons squad with sniper rifle and two grenade launchers.
    *   3x Infantry squad with sniper rifle.

    *   Storm trooper squad.
    *   Company command squad with sniper rifle.
    *   Ratling squad.


In the back, one of the two armoured Sentinels (this with a missile launcher, the other one – not in the pic – with an autocannon) and three drones/gun emplacements (for which I have yet to figure out the IG equivalent).

Not too shabby…

Oh, and look at the new ride for my Knights! Thanks Shelly and Bart

June was a month of regroup, acquisition and planning. Basically, slow down with the production to build up the reserves

By Wednesday, I should be able to bring my Deathwing to at least 3,145 points (more points to be added according to the dreads/land raiders weapon loadouts). Eventually I’d like to start my Ravenwing and my 3rd company, if not even touching my attached Imperial Guard platoon…

At this point, I would recommend to collectively aim for an Apocalypse game in September/October, with some games in the middle to familiarize with the new rules (i.e., a 1,000/1,500 points game with Apocalypse rules, just to make it faster).

How does that sound?

Alternate Belial?

Do I buy a bunch of Rhinos from eBay? I feel like I should.
