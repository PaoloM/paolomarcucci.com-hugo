<div class="info">(this post originally appeared on the forums of <a href="http://crankyoldgamer.net/CrankyBlog/">Cranky Old Gamer</a>, a very fine website run by my friend Greg Buron)</div>

I have two Land Raiders, a venerable dreadnought and another Deathwing termie squad (for good measure) to finish. Hopefully by July.

I have no idea when I’ll be able to tackle the 3rd company

**Updated on July 3, 2013**

And here we start

Experimenting with some layers of Vallejo polished gold, nuln oil and gold drybrush on the left panel. Looks almost decent…

This is not looking good for the Imperium…

Maybe Mikhail will change the tide of war…

HAI GUYS!

In other news, I was planning to magnetize these guys, but I found out that sometimes a simple pin can work wonders… still missing the tripod for the heavy bolter in the disembarked scenario.

One more thing, where do I find cool helmeted heads for my scouts?

**Updated on July 8, 2013**

Ze tripod.

And the full heavy bolter emplacement. I’m kinda surprised how nice it turned out

**Updated on July 9, 2013**

Inspired by [this Storm build](http://thenerdstore.blogspot.com/2010/11/land-speeder-storm-project-log.html), I got [these heads](http://www.pig-iron-productions.com/hd17-system-trooper-alternative-heads-p-54.html). Let’s see how they fit when they finish slugging their way across the Atlantic…

**Updated on July 9, 2013**

And back to our July challenge, I did a quick points calculation of the overall forces in my possession (not all painted by any means):

Dark Angels Deathwing: 3,145 points
Dark Angels Ravenwing: 380 points
Dark Angels 3rd Battle Company: 2,265 points
Dark Angels 10th Scout Company: 330 points
Imperial Guard detachment: 549 points

Total: 6,669 points

This is not precise, as weapon loadouts may vary depending on the deployment, but I’m well on my way for a reasonable Apocalypse game

**Updated on July 10, 2013**

First look at the scout uniforms. I tried to shade the pilot (not in the photos) with nuln oil, as I didn’t want to go too warm on his cloth (by using, say, seraphim sepia). But I’m not 100% convinced by the results. Any suggestion for shading, short of dipping him into quickshade?

The headless scouts. The two in the back are not washed yet and -again – they’re waiting for their british heads.

<a href="/blog/images/invigilus1.jpg">![invigilus1](/blog/images/invigilus1.jpg)</a>

**Updated on July 13, 2013**

Work in progress and – honestly – better than expected. There’s a slight chance I might pull this off

And this is just a markings test.

Chapter: Dark Angels (color and insignia)
Company: 3rd (front right)
Squad: 2nd (front left and sides)
Squad type: tactical (top and front left)

Still needs to be covered in matt varnish, but I was wondering if this is an acceptable base.

<a href="/blog/images/rhinos3.jpg">![rhinos3](/blog/images/rhinos3.jpg)</a>

**Updated on July 14, 2013**

And this is how you prime the last two scouts

<a href="/blog/images/scouts1.jpg">![scouts1](/blog/images/scouts1.jpg)</a>

**Updated on July 14, 2013**

All scouts have been painted and somehow either magnetized or pinned. This is the disembarked configuration.

<a href="/blog/images/scouts2.jpg">![scouts2](/blog/images/scouts2.jpg)</a>

**Updated on July 15, 2013**

Magnetized the bases, so they can be both on the land speeder storm and off it.

**Updated on July 15, 2013**

And the Queen’s Postal Service just delivered the scouts’ heads. They look pretty nifty

<a href="/blog/images/scouts3.jpg">![scouts3](/blog/images/scouts3.jpg)</a>

**Updated on July 16, 2013**

And I just won 5 scouts, 5 scout bikes and a drop pod, still in the box for a pittance on eBay.

I need counseling. And cases! I need transport cases!

/me goes to eBay to look for transport cases…

Another use for a paint stick. Put some masking tape on the stick, tacky side up, position the models to be painted, wrap your hand in a plastic bag, go outside and spray at your heart’s content.

Also, I’m done buying prepainted *anything* from eBay or craigslist. On sprue or in the box only, I learned my lesson

Power Armour. I has it

There are 10 more guys to be cleaned up before priming the whole 7 squads, but there’s a limit to how much mold lines removal a man can do in one sitting…

They come from all walks of life, 40 of them from Dark Vengeance boxes, 10 from AoBR, 10 from a tactical box, 10 from a devastator box, some from Craigslist, some from eBay… But they’ll all be unified by a nice coat of Angel Green primer

Got a white and a red ink pens yesterday to draw the chapter emblems and the squad type emblems on the shoulder pads.

Not sure about the results, may have to experiment a bit more or just rely on paints. That reminds me, I may just need to go and buy some Vallejo Air in those colors

One pass with the DecoColor red paint marker
Two coats of Vallejo Air Scarlet Red

Which one looks better?

This painting technique is also called “let’s throw some random paint from 3 feet away and see if I can pass it for something that’s actually worth money”. Hey, it worked for Pollock, right?

Alright, after a bit of pause from modelling, primed all the bolters for the 3rd company tactical squads and primed the Aegis defense line.

Next on the list, paint all the bolters and finish the 3rd company.

Further down the list, assemble and prime the Ravenwing’s 12 bikes and 3 Land Speeders.

Dunno if I can finish (properly) all this in two weeks

The one on the left has the Blade of Caliban, while the one on the right has a regular power sword. I guess it shouldn’t matter, but…

**Updated on September 6, 2013**

The painting! It never stops!

**Updated on September 6, 2013**

But I am almost done. The to do minis (plasma glow effects, badges, hair, odds and ends) fit on the work table now and then all it’s left (!) is basing and shading of 7×10 men squads, finish painting the company master and the interrogator-chaplain (and base/shade those as well), plus figuring out how to make an apothecary without a narthecium

Oh, and putting company/chapter decals on all of them

**Updated on September 6, 2013**

So in the end, the 3rd battle company should look like this:

Company Master
Librarian
Interrogator-Chaplain

Command squad (company banner, plasma gun, company champion, *apothecary*)

1st Veterans tactical squad (plasma gun and plasma cannon) + *drop pod*
2nd Tactical squad (plasma gun and plasma cannon) + Rhino transport
3rd Tactical squad (plasma gun and plasma cannon) + Rhino transport
4th Tactical squad (plasma gun and plasma cannon) + Rhino transport
5th Tactical squad (plasma gun and plasma cannon) + Rhino transport
6th Tactical squad (plasma gun and plasma cannon) + Rhino transport
*7th Assault squad*
*8th Assault squad*
9th Devastator squad (2x heavy bolters, 2x lascannons) + *Razorback*
10th Devastator squad (3x missile launchers, multi-melta) + *Razorback*

Land Raider Achilles
*Land Raider Crusader*

(the stuff between asterisks is either still on the sprue or I have to buy it)

Anything else missing?  Maybe some dreadnoughts?

**Updated on September 6, 2013**

Yeah, flyers belong to the ravenwing. I have two land raiders but I should definitely add some predators.

Alright guys, ready to be based? Please form a single line…

In helpful news, buying jump packs on GW’s website is effectively quite cheaper than anything I found on eBay.

This, plus a couple of bits from the eBays, will make me be able to field two 5 man assault squads, bringing me even closer to complete the 3rd battle company
