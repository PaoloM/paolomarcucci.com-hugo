<div class="info">(this post originally appeared on the forums of <a href="http://crankyoldgamer.net/CrankyBlog/">Cranky Old Gamer</a>, a very fine website run by my friend Greg Buron)</div>

Besides compiling the 8000 pts army list and completing the army itself, I thought it would be nice if we were to create better objective markers for our armies.

So, here’s my challenge: create 1 relic, 5 objective markers and 6 mistery markers (the ones with the number on one side) following the Dark Angels theme by next phase.

Some examples:

I failed already.

Gents, let me introduce you to the land speeder Namaan, part of the 4th Ravenwing Attack Squadron, piloted by brother Didius and brother Flavius at the heavy bolter.

Let it be recorded as my first completed Ravenwing model

Okfine. These are the ones used in the Scouring missions, they should all look the same but they have numbers on the back.

I’ll work on the other ones later

All Deathwing dreadnoughts weapons are now complete! One more thing off my ever-expanding plate

Oh, sergeant Abdiel… are you bringing two new Termie squads to the Deathwing? Are you really?

How nice of you

Mistery boxes. What could possibly be used for?

I tried to cut one inch circles to fit the minis standing but it didn’t work for a number of reasons. Now it’s just 1/2″ foam cut to fit the bottom and top of the boxes. Once closed, the minis do not move but they’re not crushed.

Now I’ll paint the boxes in the appropriate colors, green, bone white, black, etc, and stick description, points and maybe some rules under the bottom for easy reference

All together now!

There are pretty much no weapons on this vehicle. There’s a large antenna on the top and I plan to leave the cowl unglued so you can see the inside.

Maybe i can magnetize that, we’ll see…

**Updated on January 3, 2014**

Makes sense. But what about tomorrow, when Sol will get me my Sammael? How will I be able to stop procrastinating my Ravenwing?

**Updated on January 3, 2014**

Also, I had to glue the internal compartment of the tank together so it fits square, but now the space is really tight and I am not sure spraying it bone white would actually get decent coverage.

It may be time to resurrect my airbrush and finally have it do something interesting

**Updated on January 4, 2014**

Apparently my airbrush was still working. It’s a tad bit darker than what I wanted, but it’ll do

And now the control panels are done. They look a lot less messy in real life

Am I crazy for lusting after one (or two, or three) of those rumoured Knights?

**Updated on February 21, 2014**

At $140 each, its a bit of a problem…

So. How would you work one of those in a Dark Angels army? Are knights talked about in any book?

**Updated on February 27, 2014**

Digital White Dwarf acquired. Imperial Knight on order. Now, to pick a scheme/house…

The green one is a vanilla Land Raider (with double lascannons and twin-linked heavy bolters), the bone one is a redeemer/crusader. Still thinking if I want to magnetize the sponsons…

In the photo above, the doors are just held together with bluestuff for painting.

**Updated on March 13, 2014**

Still undecided on the house/scheme. I was thinking the house of Krast ([http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/House_Krast](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/House_Krast)) because of the mutual “annoyance” with Chaos forces. Their history kinda mirrors the fall of Caliban, so it could be a match.

Thoughts?

**Updated on March 13, 2014**

Specifically, this scheme:

Look at them all shiny waiting for the Quickshade to dry up

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/deathwing-2.jpg">![deathwing-2](/blog/images/deathwing-2.jpg)</a>**

**Updated on May 26, 2014**

I tried the drill method for those.

Basically, get a large screw or nail, put in the drill bit and then use some heavy duty double sided tape to attach a mini to it. Dip it as it is in the quickshade, let it drip for a second and then put the drill head in a large paper bag.

Go at it for 20 seconds and it’s done. Less messy than shaking it and it can be done inside.

Note: doesn’t work well for metal minis

**Updated on May 27, 2014**

I have to say, QuickShade (drill method) + Dullcote is *excellent*.

**Updated on May 29, 2014**

Yes. I can do demos if needed

**Updated on June 8, 2014**

Well, it’s still missing a Land Raider (wip), but here’s the 1st company, the Deathwing.

Let’s start with HQ

And then the terminator squads.

**Updated on June 15, 2014**

Well yeah, that’s it.

36 terminators, one watcher in the dark, 3 dreadnoughts, one land raider.

**Updated on June 18, 2014**

Well, I would need a proper setting for that. Doing the “fashion shots” on your battletable would be perfect

**Updated on June 22, 2014**

So, I got this guy all basecoated and mostly painted up. The problem is that I can apply nuln oil to the silver/steel parts but what should it do with the body? It’s probably too big for QuickShade, and I’m going to do some weathering on the edges, but how do I deal with the big flat surfaces?<a href="/blog/images/lr2.jpg">![lr2](/blog/images/lr2.jpg)</a>
