Summer is the killer of commitments.

Besides being a bit busy shipping a phone, and enjoying a delightful vacation to Tuscany, I confess that I’ve slacked. A lot. So, I decided to get back on the saddle and try to finish my Dark Angels.

I am fairly close, at this point; putting the final touches on two Land Raiders, building an Imperial Knight, building pretty much my whole Ravenwing company, completing the scout company, and a drop pod.

Technically, I’d need three more rhinos, two drop pods and two dreadnoughts to field a fully fleshed set of companies, but that may have to wait.

So!

For the 2014 fall season, I pledge to complete all the models I have listed above.

FOR THE LION!

Some progress on my Deathwing Knights transport…

It’s like watching mud dry…

**<a href="/blog/images/lrdw2.jpg">![lrdw2](/blog/images/lrdw2.jpg)</a>Updated on August 12, 2014**

Done!

Last night I noticed that, with the completion of the Land Raider, my 1st company is completed (as in, I have no slots to fill or other models to finish, but I can always add stuff later).

Feels good

**Updated on August 23, 2014**

Third Land Raider is done. Getting close to complete the Armory, but I have ran out of models for that (still need two drop pods and two dreadnoughts).

And so it begins…

**<a href="/blog/images/ik01.jpg">![ik01](/blog/images/ik01.jpg)</a>Updated on August 24, 2014**

Tried some Krylon paint I had left over from last year Halloween pumpkin painting experiment. Looks pretty good and it’ll look better after a judicious application of nuln oil…

Greg: I could use those DA models, how much for them?

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/ik02.jpg">![ik02](/blog/images/ik02.jpg)</a>Updated on August 24, 2014**

Moar progress. This is actually a very cool kit…

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/ik03.jpg">![ik03](/blog/images/ik03.jpg)</a>Updated on August 24, 2014**

Can’t stop, won’t stop.

**<a href="/blog/images/ik04.jpg">![ik04](/blog/images/ik04.jpg)</a>Updated on August 26, 2014**

OMG RED!

&nbsp;

Freehanding. Not completely hideous…

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/ik06.jpg">![ik06](/blog/images/ik06.jpg)</a>Updated on August 27, 2014**

Moar freehanding. I’m done for the night

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/ik07.jpg">![ik07](/blog/images/ik07.jpg)</a>Updated on August 31, 2014**

Top carapace mostly done. Still some details on the silvery frame around the armour plates but we’re getting close.

Also the Krast gauntlet crushing the Golden Serpent came out pretty nice

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/ik09.jpg">![ik09](/blog/images/ik09.jpg)</a>Updated on August 31, 2014**

Moar pictars! The amount of detail work required by this kit is crazy. But I’m vary happy with how it’s turning out…

Fancy new troops arrived during the weekend: a full 10 man Assault squad, two Razorbacks and a dreadnought.

All have been primed Caliban green and are waiting to be completed this week, when the other Rhino (for the 1st Veteran Squad) and dreadnought (to complete the lance) will arrive.

eBay, I hate you

**Updated on September 8, 2014**

In other news, if the new Space Hulk rumors are true, I’m getting a set. In that case, what would be the best way to get one? Online?

**Updated on September 8, 2014**

And it goes without saying that, if they’re still Blood Angels, they’ll be quickly converted into Deathwing, of course

**Updated on September 12, 2014**

Damage done. Ordered Space Hulk, should be here on the 20th

**Updated on September 13, 2014**

Current stuff on deck: 1 assault squad, 1 rhino, 2 razorback, 2 dreadnoughts, 1 knight errant.

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/sh01.jpg">![sh01](/blog/images/sh01.jpg)</a>Updated on September 29, 2014**

Some progress. Right arm weapons are fully magnetized, there’s the paint job on the chainsaw to be done and some detailing on rivets and such, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/ik18.jpg">![ik18](/blog/images/ik18.jpg)</a>Updated on October 5, 2014**

Little experiment putting a primed dread in front of my monitor…

It’s my left monitor wallpaper (see the little mouse pointer on the left?). I put a small box in front of it, the knight on top and just took a photo with the phone at level.

The “sun” is actually the reflection on the matte display of my work lamp

**Updated on October 26, 2014**

Some more work done on my assault squads. Some more detailing, some decals, a nice bath in QuickShade, dullcote, base paint and they should be ready.

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/as01.jpg">![as01](/blog/images/as01.jpg)</a>Updated on November 5, 2014**

Not enough, apparently…

“Dark Angels: A Dark Vengeance Expansion Set -&gt; £85, $140 USD, €110
9 miniatures (Includes a Ravenwing Command Squad, 5 Deathwing Knights and a Dark Talon)”

From[http://spikeybitsblog.com/2014/11/new-marine-releases-for-next-week.html](http://spikeybitsblog.com/2014/11/new-marine-releases-for-next-week.html)

The assault squads are done, now finishing the three rhino/predators and two dreadnoughts to finally complete the 3rd company.

Finally some air support?

**Updated on November 5, 2014**

After some rough calculations, I might have 9000+ points between painted and not. 7821 points are painted.

**Updated on November 18, 2014**

9,422 to be precise. Plus another couple of characters that I’ve yet to assemble at 325 points.

**Updated on November 19, 2014**

I think I’m ok with 4 companies plus some assorted detachments

**Updated on December 9, 2014**

Just something whipped up while waiting for the QuickShade to dry on the chapter command squad…

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/DAgarrisonStandard.jpg">![DAgarrisonStandard](/blog/images/DAgarrisonStandard.jpg)</a>Updated on December 26, 2014**

Well, that completes my plan for my Dark Angels. Anything extra is going to be… extra

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/xmasgifts.jpg">![xmasgifts](/blog/images/xmasgifts.jpg)</a>Updated on December 26, 2014**

So, better a Land Speeder Vengeance or a Ravenwing Darkshroud?

**Updated on December 26, 2014**

More work in progress. Asmodai is slowly getting painted, while Ezekiel waits for the Quickshade to dry.

&nbsp;

Thank you

As a PSA, let it be known that Quickshade and Dullcote are not 100% compatible. For some reason, spraying Dullcote even after 48 hours on a Quickshaded model will create some crackling on large flat surfaces. I used Vallejo brush-on matte varnish on my latest model and it worked fine, next one I’ll try my old can of GW purity seal and see how that works…

**Updated on January 3, 2015**

My latest finished models, from the left:

– Sapphon, grand master of the Chaplaincy (old metal Asmodai model from 1995, thanks eBay!)
– Ezekiel, grand master of the Librarium (metal)
– Asmodai (finecast)

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/PartialHQ1.jpg">![PartialHQ1](/blog/images/PartialHQ1.jpg)</a>Updated on January 3, 2015**

And finally we start with the 2nd company, the Ravenwing. These are the six bikes of the 2nd Attack Squadron, they’ll be supplemented by an attack bike and a land speeder.

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/rw1.jpg">![rw1](/blog/images/rw1.jpg)</a>Updated on January 4, 2015**

Ok, now that the Ravenwing is underway (see sgt. Hortensius of the 2nd Attack Squadron below), I’m starting to think about my little imperial guard platoon.

Remember those Vor: The Maelstrom minis?

I was thinking to depart a bit from the obvious green color scheme, so I got a can of Wolf Grey primer. With some black, blue and light grey accents, it would show up similar to the current US navy camo schemes…

The platoon would be composed by:



*   Platoon commander
*   Command squad
*   1st squad (ten men with boltguns, two of them manning a missile launcher)
*   2nd squad (ten men with boltguns, two of them manning a missile launcher)
*   3rd squad (ten men with boltguns)
*   4th squad (ten men with boltguns)
*   5th squad (ten men with boltguns)
*   Armoured sentinel squad (two sentinels with autocannons and missile launchers)


Before I think about this too much, any suggestions?

&nbsp;

**<a href="/blog/images/rw2.jpg">![rw2](/blog/images/rw2.jpg)</a>Updated on January 15, 2015**

Here are the two rosters. 10642 points of Dark Angels and 440 points of Astra Militarum.
