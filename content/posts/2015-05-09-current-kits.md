From the bottom, clockwise:


*   [Spitfire Mk.VII &amp; Mosquito FB Mk.IV "Operation Overlord"](http://www.hasegawausa.com/product-pages/hsgs2096.html) - Hasegawa 02096, 1:72 scale. Limited edition double kit issued for the anniversary of D-Day in 2014. Doesn't look too hard, but it will be great to get my old skills back.
*   [Ferrari Enzo](http://www.revell.com/model-kits/cars/85-2192.html#.VU6jhrpVhBc) - Revell 85-2192, 1:24 scale. Not as complex or detailed as the Tamiya one, but still something good to learn how to deal with large polished surfaces
*   [Reggiane Re-2000 ,,I. serie in service of Regia Aeronautica](http://kits.kitreview.com/sh72079reviewgp_1.htm) - Special Hobby SH72079, 1:72 scale. Limited release of an Italian early WWII plane, this will be tricky to build, but has resin and photoetched parts, plus two vacuformed canopies. Also the paintjob is already causing me convulsions.
*   [P-51C Mustang "Yellow Tail"](http://www.oldmodelkits.com/index.php?detail=1717) - Hasegawa AP12, 1:72 scale. 1993 model that doesn't look too complex to build, but the tricky part will be the steel polished finish.
*   [Messerschmitt Bf109-G6 "Grislawsky"](http://www.amazon.com/Hasegawa-Messerschmitt-109G-6-Grislawski-Plastic/dp/B00OL9YBKQ) - Hasegawa 00267, 1:72 scale. Another fine kit with a scary paintjob, this one came with the [Aires 7008](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/150826-aires-7008-bf-109g-cockpit-set) resin and photoetched cockpit kit.
The final three kits were traded or purchased from the fine members of the [IPMS Seattle](http://www.ipms-seattle.org/) chapter on 9-May-2015, during my first attendance to their monthly meetings. Very fun group, I'll be back next month!
