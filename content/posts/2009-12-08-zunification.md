So I have this car, you know, and this car came with a stock radio that was ok but wasn’t really and… ok, let’s start from the beginning.

When I moved to the States, one of the first thing I did was to buy a car. I got a used 2002 Audi A6 3.0L (non quattro) that served me well for a year or so.

The stock radio (a Symphony II) had a connector for an external CD changer that I commandeered with an Ice&gt;Link iPod adapter. I got my MP3s, put them on my 30Gb 5G iPod and linked that to the adapter that held the device by the central dashboard. All was good.

Then I got a Zune. With the Zune Pass. First a 30Gb, then an 80Gb, then an 8Gb for my wife. All the music I wanted, no question asked.

But, of course, it didn’t work in my car.

Comes June 2007 and I got a new car, a 2006 Audi A3 3.2L Quattro. Sweet little monster…

The A3 had the same stock radio as the A6, so I just moved the Ice&gt;Link install to the new vehicle and all was well again. I even replaced the radio with a RSN-E navigation system and kept using the iPod adapter successfully; except that eventually the Ice&gt;Link decided to stop working when it was too hot. Or too cold. Or just randomly when the temperature was perfectly acceptable. Then it definitely died.

So I was left with a feisty car, a sweet GPS/navigation system and no way to listen to my music.

A sad situation indeed, that I planned to solve for years and finally decided to resolve a couple of weeks ago (procrastination is awesome).

I am “Zunifying” the A3.

In the next post, I’ll talk about the overall plan, the alternatives considered and the requirements needed to do the job.

But before leaving, here’s a picture of me driving a kart at crazy speeds (notice the little Italian flag on my shoulder and the throttle pedal completely floored) :)
