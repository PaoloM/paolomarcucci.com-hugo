Well, I have decided that my focus should be into creating a 2000+ pts pure Deathwing army. That will include two more close combat squads (claws and hammers, oh my!), two venerable dreadnaughts (with autocannons and plasma for a pleasant mix of destruction power) and a land raider just to shuffle around my knights.

All these units are not in my possession yet, so I’m not sure I’ll be able to complete the themed challenge, but I have work to do with two more HQ units (Belial and Seraphicus), paint my knights, finish the command squad and the last squad from the Dark Vengeance box.

Btw, does an Excel based model and army tracking system count for the challenge?

My first foray into “fancybasing”. Not 100% happy with the colors, but I will survive.

Hello, company champion.

Except he’s not the company champion. Just your lightning clawed standard badass, member of the command squad.

Some updates during the weekend (not too much, because there was a very hot ball of gas in the sky that distracted everyone…)

First, we have some 40mm bases “au naturel”, using cork, sand and UNUSED kitty litter. Then some members of the Deathwing command squad, ready to be based, inked and drybrushed.

And here’s the company champion. I’m giving quickshade another try, this time using a brush instead of dipping. I’ll let it dry overnight and then clear coat it to see if I have better luck.

Damn, I didn’t use a proper brush cleaner and now the brush is stiff. Not a big deal, it was an old brush, but what should I use to clean Quickshade?

**Updated on March 18, 2013**

My current Deathwing company. Two squads in the center and right, and a command squad on the left. I may just point out the excessive management overhead of this organization

I’ve almost finished the company banner and ready to start on Belial.

On a side note, clear coating QuickShaded models makes them look better. They turn out a different color than the inked ones, but I am ok with that.

Standard bearer, completed! This and inking the Cyclone missile launcher were the last two tasks needed to complete the command squad.

Next step, Belial.

Belial. Painted, based, quickshaded and clear coated. In other words, done

Also, picked up [this guy](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Space-Hulk-Terminator-Scipio-/280982078973?ssPageName=ADME:L:OU:US:3160). I just love that pose and it gave me some inspiration to put together an infiltration squad.

I don’t even know what that means, in game mechanics terms, I just think it sounds cool

**Updated on March 30, 2013**

And while waiting for the badass guy, why not prime and get ready to complete a squad of Deathwing Knights, with those maces of absolution SO useful in close quarters… for, say, space hulk-like games…

Hey, look who showed up last night! He was promptly stripped of his unholy Blood Angels markings and outfitted with the sacred Dark Angel insignia, but it’s unlikely he will be trained and ready for Sunday’s missions…

Almost there, little guys…

**Updated on April 21, 2013**

Ok, Knights and 4th squad are waiting for the quickshade to dry and then pretty much all my “infantry” will be done. Still some Dreadnoughts and some heavy transport, and we could call the Deathwing company done.

Today I may start the Land Speeder Storm just to annoy other armies with Outflanks and jamming their deep strikes

**Updated on April 21, 2013**

Just to break away from Ushabti Bone for a bit, I started the speeder. Very large emphasis on *started*.

Hrm. So it turns out that a Land Speeder Storm is not technically a valid choice for Dark Angels.

This is not good.

Any suggestion on how to handle this conundrum? Fake it up? Trade the vehicle for something else?

**Updated on May 12, 2013**

hrm. Well, it’s built now but the only DA marking is the winged dagger on a side, so that could be easily removed… the crew has not been painted, except for some base green on the pilot.

Anyways, I think that – as a scout vehicle – the Storm should be fine in a greenwing army. After all, except for the first two companies, the DA follow the Codex Astartes, right?

**Updated on May 12, 2013**

Oh yeah. Apparently Wednesday I’ll finally receive my Land Raider Achilles (!) and a venerable dreadnought. That should count for any hobby challenge
