On the modelling front...

The diorama I'm building for my father in law has entered the final stretch. Figure and chopper are done, the perforated steel plank base is primed and I'm just waiting to find out a suitable glass case in order to determine the overall size of the base I'll need to build.

The "other" project (building a [IMAM Ro.57](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/103723-special-hobby-sh72082-imam-romeo-ro-57) for the <a href="/projects/the%20regia%20aeronautica%20project/">Regia Aeronautica Project<a/>), is also proceeding swimmingly, with an *hilarious* adventure in pre-shading (spoiler alert: it will turn out better than expected)

And last but not least, the next big project arrived: the [1:350 Trumpeter RM Roma](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/102921-trumpeter-05318-italian-navy-battleship-rn-roma) with all bells and whistles (extra detail Trumpeter pack, aftermarket wood deck, Lifecolor accurate color set...)

First ship I'm going to build since I built the [1:600 Airfix HMS Belfast](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/222391-airfix-04212-3-h-m-s-belfast) in 1973, this is going to be interesting :)
