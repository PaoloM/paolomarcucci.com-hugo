In my weekly visit to the <a href="http://www.skywaymodel.com/">Skyway Model Shop</a>, I finally got my [Special Hobby 1:72 Fiat G.55](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/112267-special-hobby-sh72110-fiat-g-55-sotoserie-0), a [Supermodel 1:72 Macchi C.205 Veltro](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/170287-supermodel-10-013-aer-macchi-c-205-veltro) unboxed, some [Hasegawa pilot figures](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/158976-hasegawa-35008-w-w-ii-pilot-figure-set) and two Fujimi kits to provide some flavor to the display bases: a [Kubelwagen ](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/385185-fujimi-38036-kubelwagen)(a type 82 that comes with a BMW R75 sidecar, a howitzerÂ and some figures), and a [Panzer I](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/224418-fujimi-38027-panzer-i) (that also comes with a BMW R75 sidecar).

I'm pondering exploring the Regia Aeronautica (Italian air force) during WW2... I have a decent start with three planes and there were not too many produced :)
