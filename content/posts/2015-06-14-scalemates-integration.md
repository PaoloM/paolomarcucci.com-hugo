Just a bit of a departure from all these modelling posts, but somehow related.

I wanted to show my stash and my wishlist on my website (this one you're reading now). I maintain those lists on the the incredibly excellent [Scalemates ](https://www.scalemates.com/)site, run by Tim Vereeke, and I didn't want to duplicate this data on multiple sites...

So I contacted Tim and asked if it was possible to have his site generate a RSS feed of my lists. After a bit of trial and error (mostly to render the generated RSS in Wordpress), I have two pages (Models stash and (Models wishlist) that read the feed and display it in a lovely way.

My feeds are at [http://www.scalemates.com/profiles/stashfeed.php?id=19629&amp;p=stash](http://www.scalemates.com/profiles/stashfeed.php?id=19629&amp;p=stash) and [http://www.scalemates.com/profiles/stashfeed.php?id=19629&amp;p=wishlist](http://www.scalemates.com/profiles/stashfeed.php?id=19629&amp;p=wishlist). You can replace 19629 with your user id on Scalemates, and you should be able to get a RSS chunk that represents the contents of those lists.

Very nifty, very powerful, very useful :)

Thanks Tim!
