I tried to use the Vallejo Game Color Silver (72.052) with my airbrush. I thinned it by approx. half and it was an unmitigated disaster. Color was not coming out from the nozzle, when it did it was watery, and then it stopped altogether.

Cleaning the airbrush, I found that the needle was clogged with color, I suspect that the color particles in Game Color metallic are way too big to be used with an airbrushâ€¦

Another experiment I did was to use a Vallejo Air Color chrome (71.064) with my brush, without thinning it. It works surprisingly well!

Should I just give up and move completely to Air colors?
