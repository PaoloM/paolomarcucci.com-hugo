**Work**: I finished the first draft of the Tobacco NOFAs, sent them to Anne for approval and later this afternoon I'll have to discover what goes into the Returns table...
 

**Home**: I'm "uncrufting" Whistler and finally I've started to organize my music folder. Tip: Download a picture of an album cover and stick it in the same directory of the songs files with the name "folder.jpg". Now go up a directory and select "View as thumbnails"
