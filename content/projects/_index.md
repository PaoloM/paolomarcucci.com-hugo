## Windows Phone apps

Unfortunately, Windows Phone is no longer with us. I was really excited by the idea of a phone that was user-centric and with a fresh design approach... but things end, prematurely in this case. Here are a few of the apps I managed to write and publish, collected here just for that typographical nostalgia...

* [Reader](apps/reader/)
* [Trip Manager](apps/tripmanager/)
* [FitBit Buddy](apps/fitbitbuddy/)
* [Cat-O-Genic](apps/catogenic/)

And some that were never even published...

* [D&D 4th ed Character Viewer](apps/characterviewer/)

## Modelling projects

* [The WWII Regia Aeronautica Project](the-regia-aeronautica-project/)Â - Italian aircrafts of World War II
